# Component Recipe Reference
## Reference and guidelines
This reference describes version 1 of component recipe file format.

Component recipe is a single yaml/json file for the component author to define component deployment and runtime
 characteristics in the AWS Greengrass ecosystem.
## Recipe file structure and examples
Here is a sample recipe file in yaml format which defines a simple HelloWorld application can run on AWS Greengrass
 managed devices.
```yaml
---
RecipeTemplateVersion: '2020-01-25'
ComponentName: HelloWorld
Version: '1.0.0'
Description: Hello World App for Evergreen
Publisher: Amazon
Platforms:
  - debian
Parameters:
  - name: Message
    value: 'World'
    type: STRING
Lifecycle:
  run:
    debian:
      python3 {{artifacts:path}}/hello_world.py '{{params:Message.value}}'
Artifacts:
  debian:
    - "greengrass:hello_world.py"
Dependencies:
  debian:
    shared.python:
      VersionRequirement: ~3.6
      DependencyType: HARD
```
The topics on this reference are organized by top-level keys grouped by functions, such as providing metadata, or
 defining deployment and/or runtime behaviors. Top-level keys can have options that support them as sub-topics. This
  maps to the `<key>: <options>: <value>` indent structure of recipe file.
## Component metadata
Keys in this group provide component metadata, which are usually used for processing components in the AWS Greengrass
 environment. The metadata is often used for indexing and filtering as well.
### RECIPE TEMPLATE VERSION
Define the version of recipe itself
```yaml
RecipeTemplateVersion: '2020-01-25'
```
### COMPONENT NAME
Component name identifier, reverse DNS notation is recommended. Component name is unique within a private component
 registry. A private component which has same name occludes public available component.
> note: component name is also used as service name, since component to service is 1:1 mapping.
```yaml
ComponentName: com.aws.greengrass.HelloWorld
```
### VERSION
Component verison, use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standard
```yaml
Version: 1.6.1
```
### DESCRIPTION
Text description of component
```yaml
Description: Hello World App for Evergreen
```
### PUBLISHER
Publisher of component
```yaml
Publisher: Amazon
```
### PLATFORMS
A list of platforms component declaring support. Greengrass will apply the constrains before provisioning component
 on device.
 > note: the platform constraints only support OS with text match now, no CPU architecture constraints support yet.
```yaml
Platforms:
  - debian
  - android
```
## Service configuration
Keys in this group are mostly used for defining component runtime characteristics.
### LIFECYCLE
Specify lifecycle management scripts for component represented service
```yaml
Lifecycle:
  setenv: # apply to all commands to the service.
    <key>: <defaultValue>
        
  install:
    skipif: onpath <executable>|exists <file>
    script:
    timeout: # default to be 120 seconds.
    environment: # optional
      <key>: <overrideValue>
    
  startup: # mutually exclusive from 'run'
    script: # eg: brew services start influxdb
    timeout: # optional
    environment:  # optional, override
      
  run: # mutually exclusive from 'startup'
    script:
    environment: # optional, override
    timeout: # optional
    periodicity: # perodically run the command
    
  shutdown: # can co-exist with both startup/run
    script:
    environment: # optional, override
    timeout: # optional
  
  healthcheck: # do health check when service is in Running
    script: # non-zero exit trigger error
    recheckPeriod: # optional, default to be 0
    environment: # override
    
  recover:
    script: # will be run every time service enters error.
    environment: # optional, override
    # referring to https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/compose/compose-file/#restart_policy
    retryPolicy:
      delay: # default to be 0. Time to wait between retry.
      maxAttempts: # default to be infinite. After N times of error, service enter Broken state.
      window: # how long to wait before deciding if a restart has succeeded
  
  checkIfSafeToUpdate:
    recheckPeriod: 5
    script: 
    
  updatesCompleted:
    script:
```
### PARAMETERS
Component author specifies configuration parameters used in lifecycle management scripts, and/or are accessible by
 service runtime, which can both read and write configuration values.
```yaml
Parameters:
  - name: Message
    value: 'World'
    type: STRING
```
#### name
name of parameter
#### value
default value of parameter
#### type
type of parameter. Current supported types include:
* String
* Number
* Boolean
## Dependency Configuration
Keys in the group are used for describing component deployment dependencies. The dependencies could be
 component necessary artifacts or the other components.
### ARTIFACTS
A list of artifacts component relies on as resources, such as binary, scripts, images etc. The section supports platform
 hierarchy.
```yaml
Artifacts:
  debian
    - greengrass:hello_world.py
    - s3://example-bucket/path/to/object
```
Artifacts are referenced by artifact URIs. Currently Greengrass supports Greengrass repository and s3 as artifact
 storage location.
### DEPENDENCIES
Describe component dependencies, the versions of dependencies will be resolved during deployment.
> note: Services represented by components will be started/stopped with respect to dependency order.
```yaml
Dependencies:
  debian:
    shared.python:
      VersionRequirement: ~3.6
      DependencyType: HARD
```
#### Version Requirement
Specify dependency version requirements, the requirements support NPM-style syntax.
#### Dependency Type
Specify if dependency is `HARD` or `SOFT` dependency. `HARD` means dependent service will be restarted if the dependency
 service changes state. In the opposite, `SOFT` means the service will wait the dependency to start when first
  starting, but will not be restarted if the dependency changes state.
