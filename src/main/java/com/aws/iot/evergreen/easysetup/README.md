# Easy setup script
The setup script is intended to give a brand new user of Evergreen to get started with Evergreen device quickly.
As part of that experience the user can get an fat jar for the Evergreen kernel, the script can launch the kernel
 with the customer's provided config if desired, optionally provision the test device as an AWS IoT Thing, create and
 attach policies and certificates to it, optionally create TES role and role alias or uses existing ones and attaches
 them to the IoT thing certificate.


## Getting the jar
Eventually we want to distribute the jar over CDN but while that strategy is being worked on currently a user needs
 to check out the repository and build it, use the following command for that
```
mvn clean package
```
Check the build logs to see where the jar lives
