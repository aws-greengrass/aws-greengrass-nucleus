/**
 *  Entry point to the kernel service IPC mechanism. IPC service manages the lifecycle of all IPC components
 *
 *  Server:
 *  Listens for new connections and passes new connections to connection manager
 *
 *  Connection Manager:
 *  Manages connections created by Server, connection manager is responsible for
 *  - Authenticating a new connection
 *  - Creating readers and writers for a connection
 *  - Closes connection when read or write message has IOErrors
 *  - Closes connection during shutdown
 *
 *  ConnectionReader:
 *  - Reads messages from the connection input stream and forwards them to message dispatcher
 *  - Forwards IOErrors to connection manager
 *
 *  ConnectionWriter:
 *  - Writes messages to the connection output stream
 *  - Forwards IOErrors to connection manager
 *
 *  Message Dispatcher:
 *  - Handles incoming messages from connections
 *  - Acts as an interface for modules inside the kernel to
 *    - Register call backs for an opcode
 *    - Send messages to an outside process
 *  - Manages the thread pool which process all incoming and outgoing messages
 *
 *  IPCService relies on the kernel to synchronize between startup() and run() calls.
 *
 *  How messages flow:
 *
 *  New connection:
 *  Server listens for new connections, new connections are forwarded to connection manager.
 *  Connection manager authorizes connection and creates connection reader and writer
 *
 *  Incoming message from an external process
 *  Connection reader is run on a separate thread which does the blocking read on connection input stream,
 *  Message read by connection reader is forwarded to connection dispatcher, if the message is a new request,
 *  dispatcher looks up the call back based on the request opcode and invokes the call back. The result of the
 *  call back is sent out via the same connection.
 *  If the message is a response to a previous request, dispatcher looks up the future object associated with the
 *  request using the sequence number and updates the future.
 *
 *  Outgoing messages:
 *  Modules in the kernel that need to send messages to an external process would inject into itself a
 *  reference of the message dispatcher. Module can send message using client Id of the process via
 *  dispatcher. Dispatcher will look up the connection associated with the clientId using connection manager
 *  and write the message to the connection. Dispatcher will return a future object to the module which
 *  will be marked as complete when connection responds to the message.
